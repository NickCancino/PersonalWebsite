Personal website I created using HTML and CSS.

Personal Portfolio Website — Nicolas Cancino

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This site was designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, experience, and contact information as I work toward becoming a software engineer.

You can visit the live site here: https://nicolascancino.vercel.app/



##  About the Website

This portfolio highlights:

- **About Me** — A brief introduction to who I am and what I enjoy creating.
- **Skills** — A list of programming languages and technologies I use, presented with icons and hover effects.
- **Resume Download** — A quick one-click download button for my resume.
- **Projects** — A simple project gallery featuring clickable cards.  
  Clicking a card opens a CSS-only modal with a short description of the project.
- **Contact Me** — A footer-style section with a contact form and my email.

The website is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
